A singly linked list is a fundamental data structure where each element in the list, known as a node, contains a value and a pointer to the next node in the sequence. The list maintains a reference to the head node, which is the first node in the sequence.

The insert_at_beginning method in the LinkedList class allows for the insertion of a new node at the beginning of the linked list. This operation involves adjusting pointers to properly link the new node into the list.

Implementation:

The insert_at_beginning method takes a parameter for the data value of the new node to be inserted.
It creates a new node with the provided data and links it to the current head of the list.
The method then updates the head pointer to point to the new node, making it the new head of the list.
